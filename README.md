#### Hi, Iâ€™m Supriya Kulkarni, worked as a software professional for 9 years. Currently training for Machine learning, DataScience.
#### This is a repository containing Machine learning projects done by me for learning purpose.  and exploring purpose. The projects are presented in the form Python jupyter notebooks

## Project 1

#### [Employee Promotion Prediction](https://github.com/sups1704/sups1704/blob/main/Employee%20Promotion%20Prediction.ipynb) : 
This project is to predict whether an employee should get promotion or not. The aim is to create a model to indentify the right people for promotion based on the data collected by the organization

## Project 2
#### [Medical Expenses Prediction](https://github.com/sups1704/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Medical%20Expenses%20Prediction.ipynb) :
The purpose of this project is to predict medical expenses of people depending on various factors. The aim is to identify the reason which leads to high medical expenses of a patient which is an indication his bad health and help him to improve on that.

## Project 3 (Deep Learning)
#### [Customer Churn Rate Prediction](https://github.com/sups1704/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Predicting%20Churn%20rate%20of%20the%20Customer.ipynb) :
This project is to predict the churn rate of the customers of a bank. The aim is to create a deep learning model to predict which of the customers will leave the bank in future. 

## Project 4 (NLP)
#### [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/sups1704/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System.ipynb) :
This project is made as a learning purpose to build a movie recommender system based on tfidf and cosine similarities

## Project 5(NLP)
#### [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/sups1704/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)
In this project we have taken the Airline tweets used earlier and analysed its performance on various models with imabalanced data and after handling imbalanced data.
In the end we have tried the Text Augmentation method for removing the imbalance in  data and reviewed its performance
